# GAMEPREZ Developer Kit


The **gpdk** is a JavaScript/CoffeeScript library for creating computer games that are compatible with the www.gameprez.com gameserver. 


The purpose of the **gpdk** is to help game developers bring their ideas to life on the web, using HTML5 standards such as SVG, Canvas, and CSS. 
Using HTML5 standards gives **gpdk**-built games access to the full capabilities of a modern browser's native functions.


The **gpdk** treats games as data-driven interactive visualizations where the "data" are game elements/entities by using the [D3](http://d3js.org) visualization library.
D3 was originally created at Stanford University by [Michael Bostock, Vadim Ogievetsky, and Jeffrey Heer](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064996&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6064996) and is now an open-source project.


Developers can publish their **gpdk**-based games by uploading to www.gameprez.com and get paid via ad revenue sharing.
Gamers can play games built using the **gpdk** in their browser without downloading any files or installing any plugins.
