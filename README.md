# GAMEPREZ Developer Kit


**gpdk** is a JavaScript/CoffeeScript library for game developers, compatible with the game-server that is part of the www.gameprez.com gaming platform. 
**gpdk** helps game developers bring their ideas to life using HTML5 standards such as SVG, Canvas, and CSS. 
By supporting HTML5 standards, the **gpdk** taps into the full capabilities of the browser's native functions, allowing gamers to play games without downloading files or installing plugins.
